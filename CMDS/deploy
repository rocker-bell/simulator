Gotcha! You want to **deploy your blockchain simulator project**—which has both a backend (C#/.NET) and a frontend (React with Vite)—to make it available online.

Here’s a straightforward guide to deploy this kind of full-stack app.

---

## 1. Understand your project parts

* **Backend:** .NET 6 app (with `Program.cs`, Controllers, Models, and compiled to `BlockchainSimulator.dll`)
* **Frontend:** React app using Vite (`front-end` folder under `blockchaine_simulator` with `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, etc.)

---

## 2. Choose where to deploy

Popular options:

* **Cloud Providers:**

  * **Azure** (great for .NET apps, supports full stack)
  * **AWS** (Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, or Amplify)
  * **Google Cloud**
* **VPS or Dedicated Server:** Run your app on a server you control (like DigitalOcean, Linode)
* **Static Hosting for Frontend + API Backend:**

  * Host frontend on Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages (only static files)
  * Host backend separately on Azure App Service, Heroku, or any cloud server

---

## 3. General Deployment Steps

### Backend (.NET 6 API)

* **Publish the .NET app:**

  From your project root (where your `.csproj` is), run:

  ```bash
  dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
  ```

* This creates a `publish` folder with your app ready to deploy.

* **Deploy the published backend:**

  * **Azure App Service:**
    Use Azure CLI or Visual Studio publish feature to push your app.
    Docs: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-dotnetcore](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-dotnetcore)

  * **Heroku:**
    Can host .NET apps with some configuration.

  * **VPS/Server:**
    Copy files to server, set up systemd service or IIS, configure reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache).

* **Configure your backend to listen on the proper URLs (e.g., `http://0.0.0.0:5000`)**

---

### Frontend (React + Vite)

* Build static assets:

  ```bash
  cd front-end
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```

* This creates a `dist` folder with static HTML, JS, and CSS files.

* **Host these static files:**

  * **Netlify / Vercel:** Drag-and-drop or connect Git repo to auto-deploy
  * **Serve from backend:** You can serve the `dist` folder as static files via your .NET backend (using middleware like `UseStaticFiles()`)
  * **Any static hosting:** GitHub Pages, AWS S3, etc.

---

## 4. Connect frontend and backend

* Make sure frontend’s API calls point to the backend URL (not localhost)
* In React code (`blockchainService.js`?), update the API base URL to the deployed backend URL

---

## 5. Bonus: Use Docker (optional but neat)

* Create Dockerfiles for backend and frontend
* Build containers and deploy on services like Azure Container Instances, AWS ECS, or any Docker host

---

## Summary Checklist

* [ ] Publish backend (`dotnet publish`)
* [ ] Deploy backend to cloud server or service
* [ ] Build frontend (`npm run build`)
* [ ] Deploy frontend static files to hosting platform
* [ ] Update frontend API URLs to point to backend domain
* [ ] Test deployed app online!

<!-- heroko -->

Sure! Here’s a step-by-step guide to **deploy your .NET 6 backend and React frontend on Heroku**. Since Heroku doesn't natively serve static frontends + backend easily in one app, the common approach is:

* **Deploy backend (.NET 6 API) on Heroku**
* **Deploy frontend (React/Vite) separately (e.g., on Netlify, Vercel, or serve via backend)**

---

## Step 1: Prepare .NET 6 backend for Heroku

---

### 1. Create a `Procfile` in your backend root (where your `.csproj` is):

```
web: dotnet BlockchainSimulator.dll
```

Replace `BlockchainSimulator.dll` with your DLL name (from `bin/Release/net6.0/publish`).

---

### 2. Create a `heroku.yml` (optional) or just use buildpacks.

---

### 3. Make sure your app listens on the port Heroku assigns (via `PORT` env variable).

Modify your `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`:

```csharp
var port = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("PORT") ?? "5000";

app.Urls.Add($"http://*:{port}");
```

This way Heroku can assign the port dynamically.

---

### 4. Publish your app (locally):

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release
```

---

## Step 2: Deploy backend to Heroku

---

### 1. Install Heroku CLI (if not installed)

[https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

---

### 2. Login to Heroku

```bash
heroku login
```

---

### 3. Create a new Heroku app

```bash
heroku create your-app-name
```

---

### 4. Initialize git if you haven't already

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

### 5. Add Heroku git remote

```bash
heroku git:remote -a your-app-name
```

---

### 6. Set buildpack for .NET

```bash
heroku buildpacks:set jincod/dotnetcore
```

---

### 7. Push to Heroku

```bash
git push heroku main
```

or if your branch is `master`

```bash
git push heroku master
```

---

### 8. Open your app in browser

```bash
heroku open
```

---

## Step 3: Deploy frontend React app (separately)

---

You can deploy the frontend on **Netlify** or **Vercel** for free.

### Example on Netlify:

* Build frontend locally:

```bash
cd front-end
npm install
npm run build
```

* Go to [https://app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com) and create a new site by dragging your `dist` folder or connecting your Git repo.

* **Important:** Make sure in your React code, API calls point to your Heroku backend URL (not localhost).

---

## Optional: Serve frontend from backend on Heroku

You can configure your .NET backend to serve the React build folder as static files by copying the `dist` folder into the backend project and adding static files middleware.

---

## Summary

* Backend: deploy to Heroku with .NET buildpack
* Frontend: deploy separately on Netlify/Vercel or serve from backend
* Update frontend API URLs to Heroku backend URL
* Test your full app online!
