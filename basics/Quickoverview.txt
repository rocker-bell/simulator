Great question! Let's address both parts of your inquiry:

### 1. **Standard Output (Console Output)**:

In C#, **`Console.WriteLine`** is used to write to standard output (stdout), which is typically the console or terminal.

* **`Console.WriteLine`** is the function you use to print information to the terminal or command prompt.
* If you need to read input from the user, you use **`Console.ReadLine`**.

### Example of Input and Output:

```csharp
using System;  // 'using' is used to import namespaces, like 'System' for Console functionality

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Output to the console (standard output)
        Console.WriteLine("Enter a number: ");
        
        // Read input from the user (standard input)
        string userInput = Console.ReadLine();
        
        // Display the input
        Console.WriteLine("You entered: " + userInput);
    }
}
```

In this example:

* **`Console.WriteLine`** writes to stdout (it displays something to the console).
* **`Console.ReadLine`** reads from stdin (it gets user input).

### 2. **`using` vs `#include`**:

* In C#, we use the **`using`** keyword, not `#include` as in C or C++. The `using` keyword in C# is used to include namespaces, which group related classes and functions together. For example, the `System` namespace includes the `Console` class.

  * **`using System;`** brings in the `System` namespace, so you can use `Console.WriteLine`, `Console.ReadLine`, and other classes without needing to fully qualify them as `System.Console.WriteLine()`.

  In contrast, in languages like **C** or **C++**, the `#include` directive is used to include header files, which is a different mechanism for importing libraries.

### Example of the Difference:

* **C/C++ (`#include`)**:

  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
      printf("Hello, World!\n");
      return 0;
  }
  ```
* **C# (`using`)**:

  ```csharp
  using System;  // Importing System namespace

  public class Program
  {
      public static void Main()
      {
          Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
      }
  }
  ```

### Why `using` and not `#include` in C#?

* **`using`** in C# makes the namespaces available to your program. It's a higher-level abstraction compared to the preprocessor `#include` in C/C++. It ensures that only the classes or methods from the namespace are accessible without cluttering the code with too many imports.
* C# has a runtime (CLR - Common Language Runtime), which handles things like memory management and assembly references, so you don’t need to explicitly link external files as you would in C/C++.

---

### Recap:

* **Console Input/Output**: In C#, you use `Console.WriteLine` for output and `Console.ReadLine` for input.
* **`using` Keyword**: Instead of `#include`, C# uses `using` to import namespaces and make classes available in your code (e.g., `System` for `Console` operations).

If you're coming from C or C++, these differences might feel a bit new, but they help keep C# code more organized and maintainable.
